Anywhere Fitness-09 💪

☝️ Pitch

These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere in a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.

Users can select their role and sign up as an instructor or client.

Instructors can add a class and edit the information about an exsisting class.
